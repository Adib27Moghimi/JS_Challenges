# Find similarities in arrays

## Challenge Description:

Your task is to create a JavaScript function that finds the intersection of two arrays. The intersection of two arrays contains the elements that are common to both arrays.

Your function should accept two arrays as input and return a new array containing the elements that appear in both arrays. The order of elements in the resulting array is not important.

For example, given the input arrays [1, 2, 3, 4] and [3, 4, 5, 6], the function should return [3, 4] since these are the elements that appear in both arrays.

## Difficulty: Medium

## Tests:

```
Test 1:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6]
Expected Output: [3, 4]

Test 2:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]
Expected Output: []

Test 3:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]
Expected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Test 4:
Input: [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]
Expected Output: []

Test 5:
Input: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]
Expected Output: [2, 3]
```
