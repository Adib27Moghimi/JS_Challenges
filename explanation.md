# Array Difference with Order Preservation

## Challenge Description:

Your goal in this JavaScript challenge is to implement a function called `customArrayDiff(a, b)`, which takes in two arrays `a` and `b`. The function should remove all values from `a` that are present in `b`, while preserving the order of the elements in `a`. The function should then return the modified array `a`.

## Difficulty: Easy to Medium

## Tests:

```
Test 1:
Inputs: [], []

Test 3:
Inputs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 4]
Output: [1, 3, 5]

Test 4:
Inputs = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [2]
